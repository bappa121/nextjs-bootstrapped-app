# Detailed Plan for Healthcare App Implementation

## Information Gathered
- The current project is a Next.js app with Tailwind CSS and shadcn UI components.
- No existing backend or API logic for user authentication, file upload, AI analysis, notifications, or compliance/security.
- UI components and utility functions exist but no core healthcare features implemented yet.
- The user wants a comprehensive healthcare app with core features, additional features, and strict compliance/security.

## Plan

### Core Features
1. User Registration and Login
   - Implement authentication system for patients and doctors.
   - Use NextAuth.js or custom JWT-based authentication.
   - Separate roles for patients and doctors.
   - Secure password storage and validation.

2. Upload and Store Medical Data
   - Allow users to upload prescriptions and medical test reports (PDF, images, text).
   - Use cloud storage or local storage with encryption.
   - Store metadata and file references in a database.

3. Lifetime Secure Storage
   - Encrypt files at rest and in transit.
   - Use secure database and storage solutions.
   - Implement access control based on user roles.

4. AI-Powered Analysis
   - Integrate AI services or build custom AI models for analyzing prescriptions and test reports.
   - Extract key information and detect unusual findings.

5. Automated Alerts
   - Notify users of unusual findings via email, SMS, or in-app alerts.
   - Use notification services like Twilio, SendGrid, or Firebase Cloud Messaging.

6. AI-Based Recommendations
   - Provide specialist consultation recommendations based on AI analysis.
   - Display recommendations in user dashboard.

### Additional Features
1. Multi-Language Support
   - Use i18n libraries like next-i18next for localization.
   - Support multiple languages for UI and notifications.

2. Telemedicine Integration
   - Integrate with telemedicine platforms via APIs.
   - Provide video call and chat features.

3. Health Trend Analysis and Visualization
   - Collect health data over time.
   - Use charting libraries to visualize trends.

4. Notifications
   - Implement email, SMS, and in-app notifications.
   - Manage notification preferences.

### Compliance and Security
1. Healthcare Regulations Compliance
   - Ensure HIPAA, GDPR, or regional compliance.
   - Implement audit logging and data access controls.

2. Secure Data Encryption
   - Encrypt data at rest and in transit using TLS and encryption libraries.
   - Use secure key management.

3. User Consent Mechanisms
   - Implement consent forms and tracking.
   - Allow users to manage data usage preferences.

## Dependent Files to be Created/Edited
- Backend API routes (e.g., src/pages/api/auth, src/pages/api/upload, src/pages/api/ai-analysis)
- Database schema and models (e.g., using Prisma or TypeORM)
- Frontend pages and components (e.g., registration, login, dashboard, upload, analysis results)
- Utility functions for encryption, AI integration, notifications
- Localization files for multi-language support
- Configuration files for compliance and security settings

## Follow-up Steps
- Implement backend and frontend features incrementally.
- Test authentication, file upload, AI analysis, and notifications.
- Verify compliance with healthcare regulations.
- Deploy and monitor the application.
